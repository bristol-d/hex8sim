# Hex8 instruction set simulator

This is a simulator for the Hex8 instruction set designed by Prof. David May for teaching at the University of Bristol.

For a few years, a physical version existed in Bristol, called the [big hex machine](https://bighexmachine.github.io/).

See the files in modules/ for documentation:

  * [modules/hex8.html](Overview)
  * [modules/program.html](A sample program)
  * [modules/stacks.html](Using the stack)

If you want to build the processor yourself,

  * [modulesim](https://github.com/TeachingTechnologistBeth/ModuleSim) simulates the individual components
  * [modules/components.html](description of the components)
  * [modules/exercises.html](building the processor as a sequence of exercises)

The simulator is in [hex.html](hex.html), just download the repository and open the file - all code is client-side js. The source code is in [hex.js](hex.js).
